0) What is the motivation of the work ? - 
1) What are we working on ? - Polynomials \mathbf{P}^{(m)}_{i,j}(n)
2) What are they ? \mathbf{P}^{(m)}_{i,j}(n) are 2m+1 order polynomials in i,j,n
3) How are they defined ? - Look to definitions
4) What are variables m, i, j, n ? m is natural, i,j,n are reals
5) What is the main aim of the work ? - To derive polynomials \mathbf{P}^{(m)}_{i,j}(n), to show their properties one of which is odd power identity also for even power, with binomial theorem, to show finite differneces and so on
6) Why polynomials \mathbf{P}^{(m)}_{i,j}(n) are polynomials in i, j, n ?
7) Have we to use generalized polynomial for each powr identity, not only odd ? - NO
8) What are \mathbf{U}^r(n,k) ?
9) What are \mathbf{Q}^{r}_{a,b}(n) ?
10) What are \mathbf{L}_m(n,k) ?
11) Why is the existence of such an identity useful ?
12) Why is the existence of such an identity is of interest ?
14) Should we move from Kronecker delta to Iverson convention ? - Yes, it is more simple and abvious notation
